#A particular zoo determines the price of admission based 
# on the age of the guest. 
# Guests 2 years of age and less 
# are admitted without charge. Children between 3 and 12 years
# of age cost $14.00. Seniors aged 65 years and over cost $18.00. 
# Admission for all other guests is $23.00. 
# - This looks like some sort of list?

# Create a program that begins by reading the ages of all of the guests in a group 
# from the user, with one age entered on each line. 
# - some sort of input
# - allow multiple entries in one pass

# The user will enter a blank line to indicate that there are
# no more guests in the group. 
# - This looks like a conditional 'if blank line then break'? 

# Then your program should display
# the admission cost for the group with an appropriate message. 
#  - We need to add up teh prices
# - We need to print some things
# - we need to print a messsage

# The cost should be displayed using two decimal places.
# - Can i find out how to format a float?
